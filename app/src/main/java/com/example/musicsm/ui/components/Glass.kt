 *
 * With [liquid] on, the panel reads like Apple's Liquid Glass: a light, clear blur, a diagonal
 * specular sheen sweeping the top-left, an additive rim catching the light along the same diagonal,
 * and a soft drop shadow so the pill floats above the content it frosts. This is the treatment the
 * floating bottom bars share, and they share it deliberately — the mini player and the tab bar are
 * two panes of one piece of glass, so any divergence between them reads as a mistake.
 *
 * No extra colour/saturation render effect is layered onto the blur: on Haze 1.6.x an external
 * render effect stacked on the capture layer goes stale for a frame across recompositions and screen
 * transitions (fixed upstream only in 2.x, #1333), which showed as the panel flashing unblurred on
 * tab switches and play/pause. The tint, sheen and rim carry the look instead.
 *
 * When a [LocalLiquidBackdrop] is provided, a liquid panel with a rounded shape is instead drawn as
 * real Liquid Glass (see [LiquidGlassPanel]); the Haze version above stays as the fallback.
