# MusicSM

**v3.0.0** — A dark, glassmorphic music‑streaming app for Android. Real audio streamed from YouTube via NewPipeExtractor and played through AndroidX Media3, wrapped in a Jetpack Compose UI inspired by an aurora‑glass design language (coral accent, Plus Jakarta Sans). Also plays music stored on your device.

> **Not shippable to Google Play.** MusicSM streams from YouTube and depends on GPLv3 `NewPipeExtractor`; it is a personal / educational project, not a distributable product.

## Features

**Browse & discover**
- **Home** — taste‑based shelves from your history, likes, and followed artists (*Recommended for you*, *Daily discover*, *Because you liked …*, *Forgotten favourites*, *From artists you follow*, *Albums you might have missed*), real **Trending now**, plus curated genre/mood tiles. Pull‑to‑refresh, shimmer skeletons; offline fallback to downloads/recent/liked.
- **Search** — songs, videos, albums, artists (videos cover what isn't a released song: unreleased tracks, leaks, covers, live recordings; turn on in Settings); **Album** and **Artist** detail pages; follow artists.
- **Listening Stats** — top tracks/artists over time.

**Library, playlists & sharing**
- Liked songs + local playlists (custom covers, delete).
- **Local files** — play music stored on the device (scanned from MediaStore); like it and add it to playlists like any track.
- **Import playlists from Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube** — paste a public playlist link. YouTube / YouTube Music playlists are copied as they are (all of it, up to 5,000 songs); Spotify and Apple Music tracks are matched on YouTube (by artist, title and length). Everything is saved to your library.
- **Share** playlists via link / QR code, and **scan** a code to open one.
- **Backup & restore** — export the whole library + settings to a portable JSON file and merge it back on a new install (no account login needed).

**Offline**
- **Automatic caching** — played tracks are cached to disk and replay offline, Spotify‑style. Turn it on or off, set the size limit (256 MB – 16 GB, least recently played removed first) and clear it in **Settings → Downloads**.
- **Offline backup** — a Library page (and Home shelf) of every fully cached song, playable without internet.
- **Downloads** — explicit offline downloads with a background service + notification, a Downloads page, and album/playlist bulk download.

**Playback**
- Background playback via a Media3 **MediaLibraryService**; notification / lockscreen controls reopen the app.
- **Mix** — DJ‑style transitions: the next song's opening is blended into the current one's ending, beat‑matched when tempos agree, with a bass swap.
- **Sample‑exact crossfade** (gapless when off), **equalizer + audio effects** (bass boost, virtualizer, loudness, skip‑silence, speed), **sleep timer**, high‑bitrate audio.
- The Now Playing volume slider is the phone's **system media volume**.
- Frame‑interpolated position so the seek bar and live synced lyrics stay smooth.
- **Word‑by‑word lyrics** from eight sources (Apple Music, BiniLyrics, LyricsPlus, SimpMusic, LRCLIB, KuGou, Unison, YouTube Music), reorderable in Settings; lyrics on a music video **sync themselves** to it by lining its audio up with the album version (or tap **Sync now**); share selected lines as an image card.
- **Resilient streaming** — an expired or rejected stream URL is re‑resolved on the fly, and a track that still fails is skipped rather than stalling playback. Age‑restricted videos play from the song's official audio version.

**Beyond the phone**
- **Android Auto** (browse + play), a **Wear OS** app (controls, voice search, lyrics, always‑on screen), a **home‑screen widget**, a **Quick Settings tile**, deep links / "Open with" & "Share to MusicSM" for YouTube links, and voice "play … on MusicSM".

**Now Playing** — blurred artwork backdrop, breathing album art, **animated cover videos** (in the album card, borderless across the top Apple Music style, or full screen), hue‑cycling frosted‑glass play/pause button, animated multi‑hue seek bar, glassy album‑tinted volume, an **audio output picker**, track details, queue, and live lyrics with **per‑song sync adjustment**.

**Liquid Glass navigation** — a floating glass tab bar you can **scrub with a finger** from tab to tab; it **minimises while you scroll**, tucking the mini player in between the current tab and Search. In landscape it becomes a glass **side dock**. Every list outside Home scrolls with an **iOS‑style bounce** at its ends.

**Support** — a "Buy me a coffee" option at the top of Settings pays over **UPI** (Google Pay / PhonePe / Paytm / any UPI app) or copies the UPI ID.

**In-app updates** — checks GitHub for a newer release on launch (and from **Settings → Check for updates**), then downloads the APK and opens the installer — no need to visit the releases page.

## Architecture

Single `:app` module, layered so nothing above the data layer knows the source is YouTube.

```
ui/            Compose screens + ViewModels (home, search, library, album, artist,
               player, importer, settings, stats, share, actions)
navigation/    Routes, root scaffold, NavHost, bottom bar
domain/        Pure Kotlin models + repository/source interfaces (+ recommend, match)
data/          Impls — only layer importing NewPipe / Room / Spotify / Apple Music / prefs
playback/      Media3 bridge (service, controller, resolver, crossfade, effects, sleep timer)
download/      Foreground download service
update/        In-app updater (checks GitHub Releases, installs the APK)
di/            Hilt modules (data, database, network, media cache)
widget/ tile/ wear/   Home‑screen widget · Quick Settings tile · Wear OS bridge
```

- `MusicSource` (interface) abstracts the catalog + audio; `NewPipeMusicSource` implements it against YouTube.
- `MusicRepository` moves work to IO, caches resolved streams briefly, and builds recommendations.
- `MediaControllerManager` exposes player state to Compose as a `StateFlow`.
- Stream URLs expire (~6 h, IP‑bound), so they are resolved per track at load time by `StreamUrlResolver`.

See [`.codemap.md`](.codemap.md) for a fuller map.

## Building

Requirements:

- Android Studio (uses its bundled JetBrains Runtime for `JAVA_HOME`)
- Android SDK with `compileSdk` / `targetSdk` 37, `minSdk` 24

```bash
# JAVA_HOME must point at the Android Studio JBR
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Notes:
- `android.disallowKotlinSourceSets=false` is required (AGP 9 built‑in Kotlin + KSP).
- NewPipeExtractor uses `java.nio.file`, so core‑library desugaring is enabled for `minSdk 24`.

## License / legal
